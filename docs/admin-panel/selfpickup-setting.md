# Self Pickup Settings

The admin can enable or disable the self pickup feature globally for all sellers. When enabled, individual sellers can then configure their own self pickup settings.

## Overview

Self pickup allows customers to collect their orders directly from your physical store location. This feature is particularly useful for local businesses and can help reduce delivery costs while providing customers with more flexibility.

### Seller Individual Settings

Once the admin enables the self pickup feature, individual sellers can configure their own self pickup options including:

- **Store Location**: Set pickup address and location details
- **Store Timings**: Set timings for pickup
