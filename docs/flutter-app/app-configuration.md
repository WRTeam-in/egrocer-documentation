# App Configuration

## Open and Run eGrocer App

1. Go to file > open > then choose your downloaded project location to open the project

![Open Project](/img/flutter-app/open2.webp)

2. If you see "enable dart support" in the upper right corner, click that and go to pubspec.yaml file
3. In the upper right part, click pub get or package get and then press the run button

If you are getting errors, you can perform these troubleshooting steps:

- If firewall is on in your system, temporarily disable it and try to run the project
- If your flutter channel is not stable, change it to stable. Check your flutter channel in terminal by typing `flutter channel`

- Go to Tools > Flutter > Flutter Clean
- Go to file > invalidate cache/restart

## Change App Version

1. Go to pubspec.yaml
2. Update version: A.B.C+X in pubspec.yaml

![Version Change](/img/flutter-app/version_1.webp)

For Android:

- A.B.C represents the versionName such as 1.0.0
- X (the number after the +) represents the versionCode such as 1, 2, 3, etc.

For iOS:

- A.B.C represents the CFBundleShortVersionString such as 1.0.0
- X (the number after the +) represents the CFBundleVersion such as 1, 2, 3, etc.

**Do not forget** to execute flutter packages get, flutter build or flutter run after this step

## Change App Theme

To change app color, add your color code in lib > helper > styles > colorsRes.dart

In Flutter, color code starts with 0xff so you have to add your color hex after these 4 digits. You can change primary, secondary, font color.
