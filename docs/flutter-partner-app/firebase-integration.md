### Setting Up APNs for iOS

APNs (Apple's Push Notification service) currently supports two types of connections: token-based (.p8) and certificate-based (.p12). You can follow either one of them:

#### For Token-based (.p8)

1. Log in to the Apple Developer Portal
2. Navigate to Certificates, IDs & Profiles > Identifiers > App IDs and click the App ID associated with your app
3. On the screen for your App ID, check Capabilities > Push Notifications
4. Select App ID in next page & click continue
5. Create Development SSL Certificate & Production SSL Certificate by adding CSR certificate. Follow Apple's [Create a certificate signing request instructions](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/)
6. Navigate to Certificates, IDs & Profiles > Keys Section and add a Universal key for Notifications, which you can use for more than one app as well
7. Save and Download & keep it safe, as it will be downloaded only once
8. Then go to Firebase and add this .p8 file along with Your Key ID and Team ID

#### For Certificate-based (.p12)

1. Log in to the Apple Developer Portal
2. Navigate to Certificates, IDs & Profiles > Identifiers > App IDs and click the App ID associated with your app
3. On the screen for your App ID, check Capabilities > Push Notifications
4. Click Save and respond to the Modify App Capabilities dialog box that appears
5. To create the certificate:

   - In a new browser tab, follow Apple's [Create a certificate signing request instructions](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devbfa00fef7)
   - In the Apple Developer Portal, navigate back to your App ID
   - Click Capabilities > Push Notifications > Configure
   - Click one of the following buttons:
     - Development SSL Certificate > Create Certificate (for testing)
     - Production SSL Certificate > Create Certificate (for production)
   - Click Choose File and select the certificate signing request you created
   - Click Continue
   - Click Download to download the certificate
   - Use this file to export a .p12 file in the next step

6. Navigate in the Apple Developer Portal to Certificates, IDs & Profiles > Provisioning Profiles
7. Click the provisioning profile you'd like to edit
8. Edit the provisioning profile as necessary, and click Save
9. Click Download, and double-click the downloaded provisioning profile to install it
10. Export the downloaded certificate (.cer file) as a .p12 file:
    - On your Mac, double-click the .cer file to open it in Keychain Access
    - In Keychain Access, select Category > Certificates
    - Select the certificate to export
    - Choose File > Export Items
    - Enter a name in the Save As field
    - Accept the default .p12 file format and click Save
    - Enter a password for the file if necessary
    - Upload this file to firebase
