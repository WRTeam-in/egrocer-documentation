# Additional Configuration

## Troubleshooting Flutter Issues

If you are encountering errors when running the eGrocer Partner App, you can try these troubleshooting steps:

1. If firewall is on in your system, temporarily disable it and try to run the project
2. If your flutter channel is not stable, change it to stable:

   - Check your flutter channel in terminal by typing `flutter channel`

   - If not in stable, type `flutter channel stable`

3. Go to Tools > Flutter > Flutter Clean
4. Go to file > invalidate cache/restart

## Flutter Version Management

### Upgrade to Flutter 2.x

If you need to upgrade to Flutter 2.x:

1. For upgrade, go to terminal in Android Studio and type `flutter upgrade`. It will automatically pick the latest version with stable channel
2. If you have updated to Flutter 2.x, after upgrade run `flutter doctor`. If you see an error like "license status unknown":

3. Go to SDK Manager from the upper right corner, then go to Android SDK. Inside that select SDK Tools, then uncheck "Hide obsolete packages". Check "Android SDK Command-line tools (latest)" then apply and ok. It will download the latest version:
